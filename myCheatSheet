ls -alh.   -> you can combine all of them like this 
ls fname*  -> Shoes all files with name starting from fname(* is wild card)


#a - for hidden, h- for human readble, l for- list info

cd dir     -> go inside directory named dir
cd         ->  Just giving cd will bring you back to root folder

Editing and Viewing Files

Managing files and Directories
______________________________
mkdir dir  -> create new directory dir
touch f.txt -> creates a file named fname.txt 
cp src dstn -> copy file from source to destination
cp -r src dstn -> copy folder and its subsequent directory from source to destination
rm fname -> removes file named fname
rm -r dirname -> removes directory and directories inside it as rmdir wont work here 
rm *.txt    -> removes all files ending with .txt
mv src destn -> move file from sources to destination
